# Setup



## Microsoft Windows

The easiest way to setup a working Python environment
on Microsoft Windows is by installing the Anaconda packages.

- Download and install [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/)

- Download ffmpeg from [here](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/).
  The file is in 7z format, which you will need to extract. Extract all the files to
  c:\ffmpeg.

- For everything to work in a terminal on windows, you will need to set up environmental variables.
  by following [this guide on stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3701646/how-to-add-to-the-pythonpath-in-windows-7).

- You will need a text-editor for creating and editing Python files. If you do not already have a favorite we recommend [notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).


## Apple OS X

For this guide to work you will need to have [xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed.

- Install brew

- brew install ffmpeg

- Install pip

- pip install numpy

- pip install matplotlib



## Linux / Ubuntu 12.04

For Linux (Debian and Ubuntu) you will need to install the following packages

    apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ffmpeg
