# Introduction

The course includes a series of exercises and the necessary theory for this.
Computer simulation exercises builds on the understanding of statistical
mechanics, as students progress in Nanotermodynamik and using molecular dynamic
simulation methods, which are also presented in the course. Molecular dynamic
simulations used to solve the motion equations for many interacting particles.

## You will learn

basic python syntax and program structure of Lennard-Jones potential, molecular
dynamics equations, periodic boundary conditions, energy minimization, force
fields theory.

## You will optain the following skills

Plan, implement and use software packages 
Using python for simulation of nanosystems 
Applying selected mathematical algorithms, such as molecular dynamics methods


# What is next?

Oh, so you want to learn? Well firstly, you will need to install Python and
other packages which is done using the 'setup' guide.

After you've setup your computer, follow the week exercises.
