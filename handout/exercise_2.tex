\section{Introduction}

Hello Scientist. Let's learn how to program with functions. Pretty cool stuff.\\

Last week, the computer program you wrote was executed line by line in a top to bottom approach, i.e. the programs way of execution is easily followed by just reading the source file as you would read a book.
%
It turns out, however, that when the programs become large enough, this is no longer a clever way to organize your program since you'll eventually lose track of what is going on.
What one usually does is break up the program into logical parts, such as “initialize particles”, “perturb the particles” and “calculate properties”.
Today's exercise is an exercise in restructuring your code from last week into logical parts which we can easily distinguish.
Before we get to the exercise, we shall have a look at functions, which are essential in this process.\\

As in mathematics, functions in any programming language can be seen as a means to get a predefined output based on some input.
Also, just as in mathematics, functions can have several variables, but in programming languages
such as Python, you can essentially parse anything into these functions, i.e. lists, floats, text and even your own data types.
We'll start with some simple functions that arise in mathematics and continually extend upon them until you are ready to start with the exercise.\\

The function $f(x)=x^2$ is a good example of how you can turn mathematics into code in Python without much hassle.

\begin{lstlisting}
def f(x):
    y = x * x
    return y
\end{lstlisting}

In programming languages you provide the {\em definition} of a function, and just like on your calculator you need to {\em call} those functions before they are actually executed.
Notice the 4 space indentation, just like for loops.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Insert the above code into your script, save and execute. What
      happens? Can you explain why? {\em Hint:} Nothing happens right now. Why?
  \item Below the code you wrote above, insert the following lines of code and
    explain what happens when you run the script

\begin{lstlisting}
print f(-1.0)
print f(0.0)
print f(1.0)
print f(2.0)
\end{lstlisting}

\end{enumerate}

Functions can be defined with no or multiple arguments together with no or multiple return values.

\begin{lstlisting}
# no arguments, no return
def print_two():
    print "two"
    
print_two()

# two arguments, one return
def multiply(a, b)
    return a*b

print multiply(2, 2)

# no arguments, two returns
def man():
    height = 1.90
    age = 35
    return age, height

man_age, man_height = man()
print man_age
print man_height

\end{lstlisting}

\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{2}
    \item Type in the above functions in the script and study/understand the definitions and output.
\end{enumerate}

The reality is that our custom functions actually works like the built in functions in python (remember the \code{len(arg)} function from last week for instance), so once you know how to make one, you can essentially create as many you like.\\

To test functions we will need a list of $x$-values as input.
We could use the \code{range()} function from last week, but that would limit us to integers. Instead we use a very useful tool call NumPy which is imported as all other tools;

\begin{lstlisting}
import numpy as np
\end{lstlisting}

We can then use the \code{np.arange(start, end, step)} function.
This will produce a list just like the \code{range()} function, but this time the
\code{start},
\code{end}, and
\code{step}
can be floats instead of only integers.

\begin{lstlisting}
x_list = np.arange(0, 10, 0.1)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{3}
  \item Define the following function using \code{np.exp()}.
    \begin{align}
        h(x) = \frac{1}{x} + e^{5x}
    \end{align}

  \item Define a list of $x$-values, ranging from -1 to 1 with a step size of 0.1, using the \code{np.arange()} function.

  \item Plot the result using Matplotlib.

\end{enumerate}

Next let us plot something more complex. Use \code{np.sin()} and \code{np.cos()}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{6}
    \item Define the following two functions
    \begin{align}
        q(t) = 13\sin(t)^3 && \text{and} && p(t) = 13\cos(t) - 5 \cos(2t) - 2 \cos(3t) - \cos(4t)
    \end{align}

    \item Define a list of $t$-values from $-2\pi$ to $2\pi$.
      {\em Hint:} Use \code{np.pi} to get the value of $\pi$.

    \item With the $t$ values, save two new lists with the corresponding $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ values.

    \item Make a plot using $p(t)$ values as $x$-values and $q(t)$ values as $y$-values.
        {\em Hint:} Using a red line (\code{'r-'}) would be most appropriate color to choose.


\end{enumerate}

\section{Interacting particles - The Hard Sphere Model}

Goal of today

\begin{itemize}
  \item Restructure the program from last week using functions.
  \item Allow the particles to interact by measuring the distance from all the other particles
    and if two particles are close make a reflection.
  \item Count particles and estimate when an equilibrium condition has been established.
\end{itemize}

As a starting point for your code, you should copy over your solution to last
weeks exercise. If you didn't finish the exercises last week, download the file
\code{week1\_solution.py} from Absalon. The following code should be seen as
inspiration for how the code should be structured after this exercise is done.

\begin{lstlisting}
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import video # 2d Video

def distance(x_i, y_i, x_j, y_j):
    """
    Return the distance between i and j
    """
    return d


def initialize_particles(n_particles):
    """
    Initialze particles, positions and velocities
    """
    return positions_x, positions_y, velocities_x, velocities_y


def simulate_step(positions_x, positions_y, velocities_x, velocities_y, dt):
    """
    Here we simulate a step dt for all particles.
    """
    return positions_x, positions_y, velocities_x, velocities_y


# Run the simulation
n_particles = 40
n_steps = 10000
dt = 0.001
X, Y, Vx, Vy = initialize_particles(n_particles)

plot_particles(X, Y, 'coordinates_start.png')

for n in range(n_steps):
    X, Y, Vx, Vy = simulate_step(X, Y, Vx, Vy, dt)

    if n % 10 == 0:
        video.add_frame(X, Y)

video.save('week2_video')

\end{lstlisting}

\newpage
Important note.
Notice how the bottom part of the script is the code that actually calls the
appropriate functions to make the simulation.  This makes reading the overall
structure of the program easier because you can now see how the program is
executed and then inspect the appropriate functions.  Also, it is not important
in what order your functions are defined. What matters is the order in which you
call them. This is different than e.g. variables, which have to be defined and have a value assigned before you use them.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{0}
  \item Inspect the above code and restructure your own code from last week to have the
    same structure and functions.
\end{enumerate}

Remember that this is only done because it is easier to read, and in
the end it is up to yourself to decide how you want to structure your
programs.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{1}
  \item Finish the function \code{distance()} and make it return
    the distance \code{d} between particle $i$ and $j$.

\item Extend your program to create a new variable \code{r\_min} and set its
    value to 0.03.
    This is the distance that the two particles $i$ and $j$ have to be within each other
    in order to interact.

\end{enumerate}

We need to get the interaction between all the possible particle pairs.
This can be done by looping over each particle twice.

\begin{lstlisting}
for i in range(n_particles):
    for j in range(n_particles):
        print "Interacting particles", i, "and", j
\end{lstlisting}

Since the particles are interchangable, this will count each interaction twice.
We also want to skip the interaction if particle $i$ is the same as $j$.
All this can be solved by a simple \code{if}-statement.

\begin{lstlisting}
if i > j:
    print "Interacting particles", i, "and", j

\end{lstlisting}

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{3}
  \item Before implementing the solution, check that the above loop and
      if-statement works as expected, and checks all unique interactions only once. 
      {\em Hint:} Use a print statement.

  \item Modify your code to loop over all particle interactions. Print the
    distance between the two particles interacting.

\end{enumerate}

To let the particles interact, we will use a simple model. The
particles are considered as being small disks with a diameter of \code{r\_min} that experience
perfect elastic scattering when particle $i$ comes into contact with particle $j$.
(Think of a game of billiards.)

When two particles collide elastically they will exchange velocities.
For simplicity this is done by simply setting

\begin{align}
  \vec{v}_i = \vec{v}_j & & \text{and} & & \vec{v}_j = \vec{v}_i
\end{align}

This is of course an approximation of what should happen, which would depend on the collision angles.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{5}
  \item Implement in your code this exchange of velocities for particles upon
    collision. Use the following if-statement as inspiration.
    {Hint:} Save the velocity of particle $i$ in a temporary variable.

\begin{lstlisting}
if d < r_min:
    # Collision
\end{lstlisting}

\end{enumerate}

As a final part of todays exercise, we can extract some useful information from the simulation.
Since the system we are investigating is not the most physical correct one and
particle positions do tend to be a bit boring by themselves, we shall instead
sample a property, which shows that the system is indeed random.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{6}
  \item For each 5 steps in your simulation, calculate the number of particles
    that are present in the interval $x \in [0, 1]$.
    Append that number to a list named \code{partdist}.  To get proper results,
    you need to change \code{n\_steps} to 20000 and \code{n\_particles} to 40.

    {\em Note:} Remember to disable saving of the video when running with large
    steps!

\end{enumerate}

We want a histogram of how often $N$ particles occurred in the above
interval. So the $x$-axis should give you the number of particles we have
encountered in the interval, and the $y$-axis how often that number
has occurred.\\

To plot the information from the list we can use the matplotlib histogram as follows

\begin{lstlisting}
plt.hist(partdist, bins=range(0, n_particles), align='left')
plt.savefig('dist_histogram.png')
\end{lstlisting}

which is inserted after the main loop over \code{n\_steps}.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{7}
  \item Plot the histogram, complete with title and labeled axis, and comment on the results, i.e. how is the
    distribution of particles in the interval?

  \item Make another list named \code{partdisteq}. Here you should store the
    number of particles in the same interval as above, but only {\bf after}
    10000 calibration steps have passed. Plot it on a new figure and comment
    on the result.

\end{enumerate}
